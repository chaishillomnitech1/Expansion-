**Directive:** Sovereign Trigger Framework | Verified QR Signature Enabled  
**Status:** Phase 3 — Fortification + Real-Time Audit + Smart Signature Logic

---

## Advanced Options & Implementations

### 1. Implement Additional Security
**Token Shielding:**  
- Use environment variables (`process.env`) for all `GITHUB_PAT` access  
- Never expose tokens in frontend code  
- Use encrypted storage when necessary

**Backend Route Protection:**  
- Create Vercel API routes (`/api/trigger.js`)  
- Add basic token matching or OAuth header validation  
- Optionally restrict dispatch access by IP/domain

---

### 2. Activate Real-Time QR Signature Validation
**Frontend Scanner:**
- Use libraries like `html5-qrcode` or `Instascan`
- Validate that scanned QR matches an expected SHA256 string or public key

**Smart Contract Verification:**
- Upload signature hash to blockchain (Polygon, Arbitrum, etc.)
- Scan matches on-chain record to confirm authenticity

### 3. Automate Sovereign Dispatch Logging
**Audit Trail Automation:**
- Use tools like Supabase, Notion, Firebase, or even GitHub issues to log every workflow dispatch
- Log fields: timestamp, QR used, status, workflow type, result

**Optional Enhancements:**
- Build internal Notion or Markdown-based dispatch history vault  
- Email webhook on each successful trigger for signature timestamping
