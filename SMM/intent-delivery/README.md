# Dynamic Sovereign Intent Delivery System

## Overview

The Dynamic Sovereign Intent Delivery system manages the distribution of Sovereign Intent Letters to all 50 Family Compounds within the ScrollVerse network. Each delivery is calibrated based on the compound's state of consciousness and resonance frequency.

## Features

### 1. Consciousness-Based Delivery
- Each compound has a consciousness state tracked in real-time
- Delivery resonance is dynamically calibrated
- Adaptive frequency tuning (432Hz, 528Hz, 963Hz, 1111Hz)

### 2. 50 Family Compounds
All compounds are strategically distributed across:
- North America - Strategic Command
- Europe - Heritage Center
- Asia - Tech Hub
- Africa - Resource Base
- South America - Expansion Nexus
- Middle East - Sacred Ground
- Australia - Pacific Command

### 3. Intent Types

#### Awakening Protocol
- **Resonance**: 528Hz (Love frequency)
- **Purpose**: Initial consciousness activation

#### Sovereign Activation
- **Resonance**: 963Hz (Divine consciousness)
- **Purpose**: Full network integration

#### Infinite Expansion Directive
- **Resonance**: 1111Hz (Manifestation)
- **Purpose**: Growth and abundance protocols

#### Unity Convergence
- **Resonance**: 432Hz (Universal harmony)
- **Purpose**: Compound synchronization

## Usage

```javascript
const SovereignIntentDelivery = require('./sovereign-intent-delivery');

const delivery = new SovereignIntentDelivery();

// Deliver to specific compound
const letter = await delivery.deliverIntent(1, 'awakening', {
  urgency: 'high',
  customMessage: 'The time is now.'
});

// Deliver to all compounds
const broadcast = await delivery.deliverToAllCompounds('expansion');

// Check compound status
const status = delivery.getCompoundStatus(1);
console.log(status);
```
