## 7. Governance Token Economics

### ScrollCoinV2 (SCRLV2) Integration

**Token Utility in Star Atlas DAO:**
1. **Voting Rights**: 1 SCRLV2 = 1 vote in cross-chain governance proposals
2. **Staking Rewards**: SCRLV2 stakers earn yield from bridge fees
3. **Proposal Deposits**: Required for submitting major governance proposals
4. **Liquidity Mining**: Incentives for ATLAS-SCRLV2 liquidity provision

**Token Distribution:**
- **FlameHeirs Council**: 15% (time-locked, 3-year vesting)
- **DAO Treasury**: 25% (governed by proposal votes)
- **Liquidity Incentives**: 30% (distributed over 5 years)
- **Community Airdrop**: 20% (to active Star Atlas participants)
- **Development Fund**: 10% (for ongoing improvements)

**Economic Alignment:**
- No token dumps: All council allocations have linear vesting
- Buyback mechanism: Protocol fees used to buy and burn SCRLV2
- Dynamic supply: Inflationary rewards balanced by deflationary burns
- Cross-ecosystem value: SCRLV2 utility spans multiple blockchain networks
