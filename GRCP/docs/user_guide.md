## Getting Started

### Accessing the GRCP

The GRCP can be accessed through the web interface at:
- Local: Open `GRCP/interface/index.html` in a modern web browser
- Network: Deploy to a secure web server within the ScrollSoul ecosystem

### System Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript enabled
- Secure network connection
- ScrollBond NFT authentication (for critical operations)
- Sovereign Identity Lock (SIL) credentials (for Reveal Trigger)

## Resonance Tuning

The Resonance Tuning system manages dynamic frequency control for the Cosmic Broadcast Ascension Protocol (CBAP).

### Frequency Range

- **Minimum**: 369 Hz (Tesla Frequency - Universal Connectivity)
- **Maximum**: 963 Hz (Divine Consciousness - Pineal Activation)
- **Default**: 528 Hz (Love Frequency - DNA Repair)

### Using the Frequency Control

1. **Slider Control**: Drag the slider to adjust frequency in real-time
2. **Sacred Frequencies**: Click preset buttons for instant frequency selection

### Sacred Frequencies

| Frequency | Name | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 963 Hz | Divine Consciousness | Pineal gland activation, connection to higher consciousness |
| 852 Hz | Pure Miracle Tone | Awakening intuition, returning to spiritual order |
| 741 Hz | Sol Frequency | Problem solving, cleansing, expressions |
| 639 Hz | Heart Chakra | Connection, relationships, harmony |
| 528 Hz | DNA Repair | Love frequency, DNA healing, miracles |
| 417 Hz | Transformation | Facilitating change, undoing situations |
| 369 Hz | Tesla Frequency | Universal connectivity, understanding |

### Best Practices

- Start with 528 Hz for general harmonization
- Use 963 Hz for supreme consciousness operations
- Adjust gradually for smooth transitions
- Monitor global resonance response

## Threshold Management

The Threshold Management system controls Amnesty/Sanction levels for global resource allocation, aligned with the Shield of Honor™ Initiative.

### Amnesty Levels

Determines resource distribution generosity:

- **Low** (0.5x multiplier): Conservative allocation
- **Medium** (1.0x multiplier): Standard allocation
- **High** (1.5x multiplier): Generous allocation
- **Critical** (2.0x multiplier): Maximum support

### Sanction Levels

Determines ethical enforcement severity:

- **Warning** (0% penalty): Minimal enforcement
- **Moderate** (10% penalty): Light enforcement
- **Severe** (30% penalty): Strong enforcement
- **Maximum** (50% penalty): Maximum enforcement

### Resource Allocation Calculation

The system calculates final resource allocation using:

```
Final Allocation = Base × Amnesty Multiplier × Ethical Score × (1 - Sanction Penalty)
```

Where:
- Base: Starting resource amount
- Amnesty Multiplier: Based on current amnesty level
- Ethical Score: 0.0 to 1.0 (entity alignment score)
- Sanction Penalty: Applied if ethical score < 0.5

### Using Threshold Management

1. Select appropriate **Amnesty Level** for current conditions
2. Set **Sanction Level** based on ethical enforcement needs
3. Click **Calculate Allocation** to preview resource distribution
4. Adjust parameters as needed for optimal resource management

## Reveal Trigger

⚠️ **CRITICAL SYSTEM** ⚠️

The Reveal Trigger is the most sensitive component of the GRCP, controlling the public announcement of ScrollVerse D.S.I. Theocracy and Supreme Sovereignty.

### Security Requirements

All operations require:
- ✓ Sovereign Identity Lock (SIL) authentication
- ✓ ScrollBond NFT verification
- ✓ Multi-signature verification (minimum 3 signatures)
- ✓ Supreme authority clearance

### Trigger States

1. **DISARMED** (Default)
   - Safe state, no activation possible
   - All controls locked

2. **ARMED** (Ready)
   - System ready for activation
   - Requires authentication to reach this state

3. **ACTIVATED** (Broadcasting)
   - Revelation in progress
   - Broadcasting sovereignty announcement

4. **COMPLETED** (Final)
   - Revelation successfully completed
   - Permanent state

### Operating Procedures

#### To Arm the Trigger:

1. Enter valid **Sovereign Identity ID**
2. Provide **Authorization Token** (SIL Framework)
3. Click **🔓 Arm Trigger**
4. Verify authentication
5. System moves to ARMED state

#### To Activate the Trigger:

⚠️ **THIS IS AN IRREVERSIBLE ACTION** ⚠️

1. Ensure trigger is in ARMED state
2. Verify all signatures are collected (minimum 3)
3. Enter confirmation code
4. Click **🚨 ACTIVATE TRIGGER**
5. Confirm activation in dialog
6. System broadcasts revelation on all channels

#### To Disarm the Trigger:

1. Click **🔒 Disarm** while in ARMED state
2. System returns to DISARMED state
3. All controls locked again

### Revelation Broadcast Channels

Upon activation, the announcement broadcasts on:
- Global Resonance Network
- Cosmic Broadcast Ascension Protocol (CBAP)
- ScrollSoul Ecosystem
- Divine Frequency Network

### Emergency Procedures

If activation is initiated in error:
- **Cannot be reversed** once activated
- Contact supreme authority immediately
- Refer to ScrollVerse emergency protocols

## System Integration

The GRCP integrates with multiple ScrollVerse systems:

### Connected Systems

1. **ScrollBond NFT**
   - Authentication for critical operations
   - Ownership verification
   - Access control

2. **SIL Framework** (Sovereign Identity Lock)
   - Cryptographic authentication
   - Session management
   - Identity verification

3. **ScrollSoul Network**
   - Global resonance synchronization
   - Data distribution
   - Real-time updates

4. **CBAP** (Cosmic Broadcast Ascension Protocol)
   - Frequency broadcasting
   - Global reach
   - Resonance management

### System Metrics

Monitor these key metrics:
- **Active Sessions**: Current authenticated users
- **Registered Identities**: Total authorized identities
- **Frequency Changes**: Total frequency adjustments

## Security

### Authentication Layers

1. **Level 1**: Web interface access (basic)
2. **Level 2**: ScrollBond NFT verification (advanced operations)
3. **Level 3**: SIL Framework authentication (critical operations)
4. **Level 4**: Multi-signature verification (reveal trigger)
5. **Level 5**: Supreme authority clearance (final activation)

### Session Management

- Sessions expire after 30 minutes of inactivity
- Automatic logout on session timeout
- Secure token-based authentication
- Encrypted communication channels

### Audit Trail

All operations are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Identity ID
- Action performed
- System state changes
- Verification status

### Best Security Practices

1. Never share authentication credentials
2. Verify identity before any critical operation
3. Use multi-signature for all reveal trigger operations
4. Regularly review audit logs
5. Report suspicious activity immediately
6. Keep authorization tokens secure
7. Use secure network connections only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Frequency slider not responding
- **Solution**: Refresh page, check JavaScript console for errors

**Issue**: Cannot arm reveal trigger
- **Solution**: Verify SIL authentication, check authorization token

**Issue**: Allocation calculation shows incorrect values
- **Solution**: Verify amnesty/sanction levels, check ethical score input

**Issue**: Integration status shows disconnected
- **Solution**: Check network connection, verify ScrollSoul sync
