## üß† GitHub Copilot Integration Guide (Omnitech1 AI Ops)

GitHub Copilot is actively integrated into this repository to streamline task execution, debug automation, and enhance deployment flow for the Omnitech1 ecosystem.

### ‚úÖ Current Copilot Task Example

**Command Used:**  
> ‚ÄúSet up a new workflow to deploy a Nuxt 3 app to GitHub Pages using `npm run generate` and publish from the `dist` folder. Trigger it on push to the `main` branch. Include cache for node_modules and error handling.‚Äù

**What This Does:**  
- Automates Nuxt 3 static builds  
- Pushes to GitHub Pages from `dist`  
- Caches dependencies for faster CI  
- Adds fallback support for errors

---

### üõ† Recommended Follow-Up Commands
Here are useful phrases you can say to Copilot from within your Actions tab or the Copilot chat:

- ‚ÄúAnalyze last failed deploy and suggest fixes.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúImprove Terraform validation with AWS policy feedback.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúAdd Slack notification for iOS CI success/fail.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCreate test suite trigger for `npm run test` on pull requests.‚Äù
# Omnitech1 Automated Infrastructure

This repository is powered by sovereign automation systems designed by **Chais Hill**, Founder of **Omnitech1‚Ñ¢** ‚Äî a divine tech empire engineered for 24/7 operations, legacy protection, and AI scalability.

Below is a breakdown of active GitHub Actions integrated into this codebase:

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Nuxt Site Deployment
**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy-nuxt.yml`  
Deploys the Nuxt frontend to GitHub Pages every time changes are pushed to the `main` branch.

**Steps:**
- Installs dependencies
- Builds Nuxt static files
- Publishes to `gh-pages`

> **Result:** Your web frontend updates automatically.

---

### ‚úÖ 2. AWS IAM Policy Validator (Terraform)
**File:** `.github/workflows/aws-terraform-validator.yml`  
Validates all `.tf` (Terraform) files on commit.

**Steps:**
- Terraform setup
- Initializes modules
- Runs security + syntax validation

> **Result:** Ensures your AWS IAM and infra-as-code remain clean and deployable.

---

### ‚úÖ 3. iOS Build Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/ios-ci.yml`  
Automates iOS builds on push using Xcode and macOS environments.

**Steps:**
- Sets up Xcode
- Builds the app targeting the iPhone 14 simulator

> **Result:** Confirms successful iOS app builds with each update.
# .github/workflows/ios-ci.yml
name: iOS App Build (Starter)

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: macos-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Xcode
        run: sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app

      - name: Build App
        run: xcodebuild -scheme YourAppScheme -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 14' build
