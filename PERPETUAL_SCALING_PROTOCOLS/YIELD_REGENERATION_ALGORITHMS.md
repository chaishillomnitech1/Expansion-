## Section 3: Regeneration Algorithm Specifications

### Algorithm Framework

```
FUNCTION YieldRegeneration(compound_id, sector_type)
  base_yield = GetBaseYield(compound_id)
  zakat_flow = base_yield * 0.0777
  performance_multiplier = CalculatePerformance(compound_id)
  market_conditions = GetMarketConditions(sector_type)
  
  net_yield = (base_yield - zakat_flow) * performance_multiplier * market_conditions
  
  IF net_yield > target_threshold THEN
    AllocateToGrowthPool(excess_yield)
    TriggerVictoryConfirmation(compound_id)
  END IF
  
  DistributeZakatFlow(zakat_flow)
  RecordToBlockchain(compound_id, net_yield)
  
  RETURN net_yield
END FUNCTION
```

### Performance Calculation Logic

```
FUNCTION CalculatePerformance(compound_id)
  uptime = GetSystemUptime(compound_id)
  efficiency = GetOperationalEfficiency(compound_id)
  security = GetSecurityScore(compound_id)
  
  performance_score = (uptime * 0.4) + (efficiency * 0.4) + (security * 0.2)
  
  IF performance_score >= 0.95 THEN
    RETURN 1.15  // 15% bonus for exceptional performance
  ELSE IF performance_score >= 0.90 THEN
    RETURN 1.10  // 10% bonus for excellent performance
  ELSE IF performance_score >= 0.85 THEN
    RETURN 1.05  // 5% bonus for good performance
  ELSE
    RETURN 1.00  // Standard performance
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

### Compound Interest Calculation

```
FUNCTION CalculateCompoundInterest(principal, rate, time, frequency)
  // Continuous compounding for optimal yield
  final_amount = principal * EXP(rate * time)
  zakat_deduction = final_amount * 0.0777
  net_final = final_amount - zakat_deduction
  
  RETURN net_final
END FUNCTION
```
